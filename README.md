dnd-stats
=========

Just a quick python script to randomize (and colourize) some stat rolls for character creation.  Stat value range is 3-18, achieved by rolling 4d6 and omitting lowest.  Stat sum range is between 18 and 108, however with a normal distribution really low and really high values are very rare.
